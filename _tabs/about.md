# About 

Hi everyone
My name is Keegan Turner. I am a technical support consultant for one of the largest web hosting organisations in South Africa. 
I enjoy spending time with my family and learning technology. I have a keen interest in learning cloud computing and programming. 
For fun I like to spin up virtual machines and build or break whatever I can. My first project will be to document and share my learning 
journey to hopefully inspire others.
