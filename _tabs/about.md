Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Keegan 

I am a technical support consultant for a web hosting company in South Africa ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦

My day involves assisting customers troubleshoot website errors on their webserver,
mail setup configurations and providing domain support.

I enjoy working on Linux servers, reading through log files and monitoring system resources. 

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family and learning about different technologies and tech concepts such as DevOps and Cloud.

This site exists to share my learning journey in the form of blog style tutorials and guides to hopefully inspire others ðŸ˜ƒ

Take Care and never stop keep learning!
