Hello 👋

My name is Keegan Turner. 

I am a technical support consultant for one of the largest web hosting companies in South Africa 🇿🇦
When I am not troubleshooting web apps or learning something new, I am spending time with my wife and two kids. 
I have an interest in learning cloud computing and programming. 
For fun, I like to spin up virtual machines and build or break whatever I can. 
My first project will be to document and share my learning journey to hopefully inspire others 😃

Cheers 🍻
