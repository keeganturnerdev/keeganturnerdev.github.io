Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Keegan 

I am a technical support consultant for a web hosting company in South Africa ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦

My daily activies involve assisting customers troubleshoot website errors on a web server level,
assisting with email setup and configurations and providing domain DNS support.

I enjoy working on Linux servers, reading through log files and monitoring system resources. 

Outside of work I enjoy learning about different technologies and tech concepts such as DevOps and Cloud.

This site exists to share my learning journey to hopefully inspire others ðŸ˜ƒ

Take Care and never stop keep learning!
