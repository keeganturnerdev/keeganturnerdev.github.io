Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Keegan 

I am a technical support consultant for a web hosting company in South Africa ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦
When I am not troubleshooting web applications or learning something new, I am spending time with my wife and two kids. 
I have an interest in learning cloud computing and DevOps. 
For fun, I like to spin up virtual machines and build or break whatever I can.
My first project will be to document and share my learning journey to hopefully inspire others ðŸ˜ƒ

Take Care and keep learningðŸ˜ƒ
