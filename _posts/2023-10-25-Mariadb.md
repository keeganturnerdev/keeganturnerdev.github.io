*MariaDB is an open-source relational database management system. 
It is designed for data storage and retrieval and is often used in web applications.*

Install Maria DB on your instance or server via the command line

```
sudo apt install mariadb-server
```

Secure the installation

```
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

Step 2

Create the 'add user' file and add the script

```
sudo nano adduser.sh
```

Paste the below code in the file and save the file by pressing Ctrl + x, Y & Enter

```
#!/bin/bash

# Prompt the user for database details
read -p "Enter the desired database name: " db_name
read -p "Enter the desired username: " username
read -s -p "Enter the desired password: " password
echo

# Access the MariaDB server
mysql -u root -p <<EOF
# Create the database
CREATE DATABASE $db_name;

# Create the user and set the password
CREATE USER '$username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$password';

# Grant privileges to the user on the database
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON $db_name.* TO '$username'@'localhost';

# Flush privileges
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

EOF

# Inform the user about the success
echo "Database, username, and password created successfully."
```


Create 'deleteuser' file

```
sudo nano deleteuser.sh
```

Paste the below code in the file and save the file by pressing Ctrl + x, Y & Enter

```
#!/bin/bash

# Prompt the user for the database name to delete
read -p "Enter the name of the database you want to delete: " db_name

# Access the MariaDB server
mysql -u root -p <<EOF
# Delete the database
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS $db_name;
EOF

# Inform the user about the deletion
echo "The database '$db_name' has been deleted, if it existed."
```
